There are 3 ways to read text using Peruse:
1. *Upload Text* - load a .txt file from your device
2. *Paste Text* - load text from your device's clipboard
3. *Image to Text* - load a screenshot from your device which Peruse will translate into readable text.

In Peruse, users can augment the text they're reading to improve their focus:
* *guided reading* - text begins to highlight itself to keep reader's attention.
* *dark mode* - adjust text and background to reduce eye strain
* *focus mode* - brings Peruse full screen to remove distracting tabs and external interfaces
* *text size* - adjust text size to increase readability
